"2706 Olive St NW,","Washington, DC 20007","$3,500,000",3,3.5,"3,150","Affectionately referred to by its previous resident – renowned chef and television personality Julia Child – as her “little jewel, ” the butter yellow clapboard house at 2706 Olive Street has been masterfully restored by current owner Rory Veevers-Carter in a manner befitting the home where Child worked on her groundbreaking culinary tome “Mastering the Art of French Cooking. ” During her ownership, Child was rumored to give cooking classes to DC’s social set – who learned from one of the most luminous figures in food. Perched on a leafy, residential block in Georgetown, the restoration of this beautiful and historic Federal style dwelling is a love letter from Veevers-Carter to both his grandmother – an avid watcher of Julia’s cooking shows – and of course, to the inimitable icon herself. At the time of Child’s purchase – her first foray as a homeowner – 2706 Olive Street already had an illustrious, century’s old history. Built shortly after the Civil War by Edgar Moore – a leading figure in the Black community – the house is part of a vibrant tapestry of African American influence in Washington, DC during the Reconstruction era. The home was eventually acquired by Paul and Julia Child in 1948. During the 1970s, acclaimed architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen installed a wall of windows at the rear as part of a planned expansion, which the current owner has kept intact. After a lengthy refurbishment, the 3,275-square-foot house is restored to its former grandeur – albeit in the contemporary vision of Veevers-Carter, an expert in home renovations. Bathed in natural light and awash in exposed bricks and beams, the multi-level residence is equipped with luxury amenities at every turn. The entry level – which houses an expansive living room, office, foyer, working fireplace and powder room, is sun-filled – allowing the homeowner to cultivate plenty of flora throughout the turning seasons. As you move through the space, the floating staircase leads you through the breathtaking aspects of the house. At the center of this modern marvel is the kitchen – which pays homage to Child’s penchant for making use of the latest culinary gadgetry. Designed around the intersection of congregating and cooking, the kitchen is meant to inspire one’s inner chef. Replete with stainless steel Viking appliances, an eight-burner cooktop stove, double stacked ovens, a wooden hearth perfect for family pizza night, and a temperature-controlled wine fridge for the serious oenophile, the open kitchen is purposeful and prodigious. It also leads out to a spacious, yet private, patio area ideal for al fresco dining or flexing a green thumb. Drawing inspiration from the queen of French cooking, the kitchen is a meeting place for everyday indulgences, as well as special occasions. An evening spent feasting on boeuf bourguignon paired with a delightful red Burgundy feels reminiscent of the legendary dinner parties hosted by the Childs. As a whimsical touch, Veevers-Carter retained some of the original wall from the Julia years – a classic conversation starter for guests. The upper level features three brightly lit bedrooms. The master bedroom features a walk-in closet with custom, built-in shelving. An en suite bathroom with a separate soaking tub and standup shower in hued white marble makes for a striking and clean appearance. A second, full bath sits adjacent to one of the secondary bedrooms. The subterranean level is meant as a sanctuary – with a custom Hammam tiled in pink marble. Should the homeowner choose to convert the den into a home gym, the area is spacious enough for various equipment. After a strenuous workout, the Turkish steam bath is perfect for relaxation. Equipped with a laundry room and downstairs pantry, the lower level also provides a secondary entrance to the patio via a green stone staircase.",Active,40 days,Townhouse,,1870,GEORGETOWN,"1,364 Sq.

"3313 O St NW,","Washington, DC 20007","$8,495,000",6,6.5,"6,135","On a quiet, cobblestone block in historic Georgetown, stands a refined residence, fully renovated over several years by Smith Architectural Group. Meticulous thought went into every facet of this home. Original details are married with modern design elements so seamlessly that it feels as if they were always there. Upon entry, guests are offered views through the grand foyer to the reception rooms, a tranquil private garden, and an open well staircase. The formal living room boasts southern exposure and restored original windows with beveled glass. The stunning natural light extends through an opening to the dining room, which is illuminated by a Louis XV style, ormolu chandelier and gilt candle sconces in the evening, adding an opulent glow to dinner parties. Nesting doors separate the modern Bulthaup kitchen, perfectly designed for intimate gatherings or catered events alike. A series of French doors provide soft natural light, illuminating Caesarstone countertops extending the length of the twelve foot island, as well as along the perimeter. Informal seating gives guests front row seats to witness the home chef prepare picture perfect meals with a Gaggenau appliance suite, including integrated gas range and double ovens, that melds flawlessly with the modern aesthetic. Wine is perfectly chilled and at the ready in the dual zone wine fridge, whether enjoying the show in the kitchen or warming up by the fire in the informal living room beyond. When the weather is right, dine al fresco on the private wrap around terrace, featured in Gardens of Georgetown, by Edith Nalle Schafer, allowing the sound of the serene water feature to carry you away. As the evening draws to a close, a three story glass and steel installation by Graham Caldwell guides you upstairs, suspended below a skylight with the promise of a dance of light the next day. Entering the primary suite, one’s eye is drawn outside to a long balcony, then to the sumptuous bedroom, flanked by two ensuite bathrooms with walls clad in ethereal, reverse painted glass, and walk-in closets with bespoke organization systems. Each bathroom features a seamless glass enclosed shower, the larger of which boasts a Kohler steam shower for a true in-home spa experience whenever the mood strikes, while a separate soaking tub with adjacent TV offers a further venue for relaxation. An additional four hotel inspired bedroom suites occupy the remainder of the second and third floors. Overlooking the top of the staircase, where the Graham Caldwell installation “Ejecta” meets the sun, a spacious den is ideal for a home office or private getaway. Staff quarters, including full kitchen, full bath, and laundry facilities are located in the fully finished basement, with ample storage space.
